# SallyForth: A simple Forth-like language implemented in Python.

SallyForth is a simple hobby implementation of the FORTH programming
language. Possibly the most interesting thing about SallyForth is the
name, which 
[Michael Nygard suggested](https://twitter.com/mtnygard/status/1249781530219642883)
as a name for a FORTH implementation
at exactly the same time that I happened to be writing this code.

## Running SallyForth

SallyForth is writting in Python 3 and will happily run with
either the standard C Python implementation or Pypy. To
run SallyForth just kick off the sallyforth.py file:

````
$ python sallyforth/sallyforth.py
````
