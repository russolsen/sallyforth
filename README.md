SallyForth: A simple Forth-like language implemented in Python.
##############################################################

SallyForth is a simple hobby implementation of the FORTH programming
language. Possibly the most interesting thing about SallyForth is the
name, which 
[Michael Nygard suggested](https://twitter.com/mtnygard/status/1249781530219642883)
as a name for a FORTH implementation
at exactly the same time that I happened to be writing this code.
